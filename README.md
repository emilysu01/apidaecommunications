# apidaecommunications
Apidae Communications aims to create a sense of order after the events of a natural disaster by restoring communication using our low-frequency mesh network.

In the event of a natural disaster, cellular infrastructure is likely to fail, which results in the loss of communication. Apidae Communications aims to resolve this issue through a mesh network. Individual nodes similar to routers are set up in cities, acting as points of connection, which allow individuals without cellular service to send SMS messages. When the area is not affected by a natural disaster, the network will be in a low power mode using solar energy. Unlike current mesh networks, the company will sell to municipal governments. All residents in the area can then access communication services in the event that conventional services do not function.

Apidae Communications was founded by the Yellow House (the Bee Team) at SHAD Memorial University in July 2018. We are a group of eight dedicated and passionate high school students from across Canada.
